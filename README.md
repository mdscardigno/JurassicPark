##P: Restating Problem
-[x]Build Dinosaur class with properties Name, DietType, AcquisitionDate, Weight and EnclosureNumber.
-[]Add a method Description to your class to print out a description of the dinosaur to include all the properties. Create an output format of your choosing. Feel free to be creative.
-[]Keep track of your dinosaurs in a List<Dinosaur>.
-[]When the console application runs, it should let the user choose one of the following actions:

  *[]Remove
    **This command will prompt the user for a dinosaur name then find and delete the dinosaur with that name.
  *[]Transfer
    **This command will prompt the user for a dinosaur name and a new EnclosureNumber and update that dino's information.
  *[]Summary
